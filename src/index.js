1) (This has a DEMO solution.)
Create a variable that stores the name of your cafe.
Print out a greeting such as "Welcome to Technigo Cafe! What would you like to order today?"
Where Technigo Cafe is replaced by the name of your cafe that is stored in the variable.

Where true is replaced by your varible
*/

Create a variable called cafeGuests, that shows us how many cafeGuests we have.
Assign it a value.
Print it out.
Assign it a new value.
Print it out. => This should give you the new value.

5)
Create a variable called maxGuests, that shows us how many guests are allowed in the cafe.
Assign it a value.
Print it out.
assign it a new value.
Print it out. => This should give you an error because it shouldn't be able to be changed.

Should give you => "Today we have a special winter deal!"
(check for a specific string method...)
